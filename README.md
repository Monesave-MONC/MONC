1	MONESAVE - INTRODUCTION

In a world prevalent with social media, open communication and information sharing, users are still isolated when it comes to savings & budgeting. Little wonder 80% of users balk at the idea of creating a budget and tracking it regularly. Children and young adults also find savings and boring also. But imagine if we can make this fun for users? Imagine introducing a social element to this activity.
Monesave Token is not just another cryptocurrency; we aim to foster a community of users passionate about Budgeting, Savings and Financial responsibility. Operating on the Polygon network, we leverage the advantages of low transaction fees and high scalability, making it an ideal choice for microtransactions and community rewards.

Monesave is an app that allows users create tasks for their children, budget and anonymously share their budgets for review. This innovative feature connects with like-minded individuals in a secure app to share their budgets, investment ideas, and receive encouragement along their financial journey. 
Our basic idea is that we are social creatures and therefore savings money and budgeting can be a fun experience if we make it more of a community activity.

Join the movement! Join a community of users passionate about budgeting, savings and crypto investments
